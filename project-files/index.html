                <p>Let's have a little bit of fun today. Have fun with
                    it. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with
                    talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly
                    the windows to your soul. You have to allow the paint to
                    break to make it beautiful. If you don't think every day
                    is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>

                <p>Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. It is a
                    lot of fun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to
                    resist these things. Just let them happen. What the
                    devil. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

                <p>Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show
                    the light. See there how easy that is. There is immense
                    joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures
                    in nature. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm
                    not sure we really care. You could sit here for weeks with
                    your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it
                    with one stroke with an almighty brush. We don't have
                    anything but happy trees here.</p>
