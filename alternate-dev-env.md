## Alternate Development Environment Options

There are options for using Sass in a project without having to work
on the command line.

### Koala

[Koala](http://koala-app.com) is a GUI app that compiles Less, Sass,
CoffeeScript and more automatically in the background. Free. (I'm
recommending this one.)

### Codekit

Codekit does everything for you in terms of pulling your Sass,
Javascript, Templates and so on together for a working site. It is
macOS only. $39.

### Prepros

Another do-it-all tool modeled after Codekit, but available on all
three OSes: macOS, Windows, and Linux. $29

### [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/)

Not an alternative, a list of alternative ways to build websites. My
personal preference is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), but there a many
others.
